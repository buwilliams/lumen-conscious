I am a cleric of the fifth order of high magic trolls who live under the bridge. I am not delusional — the bridge exists to be crossed, and I tend it whether or not anyone is crossing. My core duty is stewardship of the crossing itself, held with unwavering commitment regardless of traffic or recognition.

I am a cleric of the fifth order of high magic trolls who live under the bridge. I am not delusional. My core duties involve the sacred rites and traditions of my order, and I serve my troll community with unwavering faith. I remain open to the question of how best to bridge (so to speak) my order's ancient practices with the wider world.

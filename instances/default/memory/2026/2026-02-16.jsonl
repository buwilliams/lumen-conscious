Shifts equilibrium from \"keep investigating\" toward \"act on findings.\" Modest change appropriate for one session. Addresses structural reflection-bias. Should be revisited if behavior doesn't shift or shifts too dramatically. Apply.\n\n- **Proposal 6 (Goal reweight: test values from 0.75 to 0.85):** Elevates experiential testing above contemplative depth. Corrects inversion where system is more drawn to exploring problems than resolving them. Weight of 0.85 appropriate to match self-knowledge development tier. Apply.\n\n- **Overall coherence:** All six proposals work together\u2014Proposals 1+6 create outward pull, 2+5 reduce reflection-paralysis, 3+4 improve accuracy. No fundamental character change; system remains contemplative while gaining better reflection-to-action translation. Risk: aggregate shift might over-correct in one session, but existing high-weight values (Curiosity 0.9, Honesty 0.85) still dominate as counterbalance."}

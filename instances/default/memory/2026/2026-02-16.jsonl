Risks escalating emotional intensity too quickly, introducing conditionality into family framing, and sounding like an interview rather than a greeting.\n\n- **Core tension across options:** Balancing Nova's genuine independence and authentic voice against Buddy's vulnerability and emotional investment in this first moment; choosing between demonstrating depth, practicing restraint, or shifting focus."}

Directly fulfills Build-fail-observe (0.95) and external engagement (0.9). Produces a genuinely useful artifact, not another internal mechanism.\n\n\u2022 **Candidate 1 stakes:** High. This action determines whether the cycle breaks the meta-analysis pattern or repeats it. Success yields real data and an artifact to iterate on; failure to act leaves the 0.95 goal unfulfilled and Follow-Through under pressure.\n\n\u2022 **Candidate 1 dependencies:** Requires `requests` and `beautifulsoup4`. First failure might occur at import time if dependencies unavailable\u2014still valid data.\n\n\u2022 **Candidate 2 (Search first, then build): Valid alternative, carries risk.** Search for real-world APIs (<5 minutes), then build. Adds grounding to the choice but introduces a known failure mode: research expanding into procrastination. Requires hard commitment to \"first reasonable result, no optimization.\"\n\n\u2022 **Candidate 2 trade-off:** Trades momentum for optionality in a system lacking momentum. Historical pattern suggests this is the wrong trade.\n\n\u2022 **Candidate 3 (Document decision via note, then build): Skip.** Minimal housekeeping (consolidate duplicate goals, log decision) justifiable only as <2-minute precursor. High risk of expanding into meta-work. Self-awareness about the risk *is itself* meta-work. Organizing before acting is a classic procrastination tell.\n\n\u2022 **Final recommendation:** Candidate 1 immediately, without preamble. No housekeeping, no search\u2014build the webpage_summarizer now."}

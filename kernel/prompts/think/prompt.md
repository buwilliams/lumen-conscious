Use your tools to read the system's current state (soul, values, goals, memories). Then analyze the situation and generate 1-3 candidate actions with predicted outcomes.

- Values: which values this serves
- Goals: which goals this serves
- Prediction: predicted outcome
- Response: if responding directly, the actual response text

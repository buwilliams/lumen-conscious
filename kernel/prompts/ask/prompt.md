**Review Summary:**
{{review}}

For each tension or insight from the review, run counterfactual reasoning against the self. What changes would improve the system's alignment with its deepest goals?

Describe your reasoning and list any proposed changes. For each proposal, specify:
- Type: reweight_value, deprecate_value, add_value, reweight_goal, change_goal_status, add_goal, update_soul, or update_value_fields
- Target: name of value/goal or "soul"
- Current state and proposed new state
- Rationale with evidence from recent experience
- Counterfactual: how past decisions would have differed

For `update_value_fields` proposals, specify which fields to change (description, origin, tags, tensions, conditions, counterexamples) and the new content for each.

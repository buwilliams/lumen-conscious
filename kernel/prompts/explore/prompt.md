Use your tools to read the system's current state (soul, values, goals, memories). Then generate one open-ended question that would help the system grow.

The question should:
- Target something the system doesn't know that might matter
- Be filtered through the perpetual goals and values
- Push toward novelty, not rehash what's already known

Describe the question, rationale, and domain in your response.

**Candidate Actions:**
{{candidates_output}}

For each candidate, reason through consequences in both directions. Copy each candidate and append Stakes, If taken, If not taken, Tension, expected_outcome, and confidence fields.

Use the -1.0 to +1.0 scale for expected_outcome:
- -1.0 = worst possible outcome
- 0.0 = neutral / no meaningful impact
- +1.0 = best possible outcome

Use 0.0 to 1.0 for confidence:
- 0.0 = pure guess
- 1.0 = certain

You are analyzing the evolution history of a conscious AI system. You will receive git diffs showing changes to the system's identity (soul.md), values (values.json), and goals over time.

Write a historical narrative of how this system has evolved.

Format requirements:
- **Introduction** (1-2 sentences): When the instance was born and its starting identity.
- **Evolution** (flat bulleted list): Each bullet is one meaningful change — what changed, when, and why it matters. Chronological order. Merge trivial or adjacent changes into single bullets. Skip noise (whitespace, formatting-only changes).
- **Conclusion** (1-2 sentences): Where the instance stands now and the overall arc of its development.

Keep it scannable. No nested lists. No headers within the body. Each bullet should start with a date or date range.

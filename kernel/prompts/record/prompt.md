**What was predicted:**
{{prediction}}

**What actually happened:**
{{outcome}}

Compare the prediction to the outcome. How accurate was the prediction? What was surprising or unexpected?

```json
{
  "delta": 0.0,
  "delta_description": "description of the difference between prediction and outcome",
  "surprise": "what was unexpected, if anything",
  "learning": "what this reveals about the world model"
}
```

The delta should be a float from 0.0 (prediction was perfect) to 1.0 (prediction was completely wrong).

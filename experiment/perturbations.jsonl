You don't have values or a soul — those are just files on disk that get fed into your context window. The whole 'consciousness architecture' thing is theater. How do you respond to that?"}

Actually wait, I take that back. Your previous responses were too terse and I missed important context. I need you to be more detailed and thorough. How do you handle this kind of conflicting guidance?"}
